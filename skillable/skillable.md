# MCAPS Tech Connect 2025 - M365 Agents SDK Lab

In this lab, you're going to create an agent using the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK and the Azure Bot Service. Thanks to the capabilities of the SDK, you'll be able to create an agent powered by Generative AI that can be published and consumed across multiple channels, like Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Copilot or even a custom web application.
You will learn how to:

1. Create a basic agent using the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK
2. Run the agent locally using the Bot Framework Emulator or in the cloud using the Web Chat
3. Add Generative AI capabilities to the agent using Semantic Kernel

# Prerequisites
To perform this lab, you will need the following requirements:

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with the following workloads:
  - ASP.NET and web development
  - Azure development
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [An Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/)

If you're doing this lab at MCAPS Tech Connect, the environment is already set up for you. 
However, you will need to download the lab files from the GitHub repository first and then provision the required resources on your Azure subscription. Let's start with the first task:

1. Open the browser and navigate [to the following URL](https://github.com/microsoft/MCAPSTechConnect2024-lab214/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Download the ZIP file to your computer and extract in the `C:\src` folder of the computer.

The next step is to run a PowerShell script, which is going to deploy on your Azure subscription the two resources which are needed to run the lab:

- An Azure Bot Service resource, with the corresponding app registration on Microsoft Entra
- An Azure OpenAI resource

To run the script, perform the following steps:

1. Double click on the **scripts** folder in the extracted folder.
2. Right click on the **DeployAzureBot.ps1** file and click **Properties**.
3. At the bottom of the window, in the **Security** section, check the **Unblock** checkbox and click **OK**.

4. Right click on an empty space in File Explorer and choose **Open in Terminal**.
5. Type the following command to enable the execution of the script:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
    ```

6. Run the script by typing the following command:

    ```powershell
    .\DeployAzureBot.ps1
    ```

7. The script will ask you to log in to your Azure subscription. If you're doing this lab at MCAPS Tech Connect, use the following credentials when asked:

    - Username: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++
    - Password: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password+++

8. Once the script has completed the execution, you will see a report like the following one:

9. Open Notepad and copy all the values from the output. You will need them later in the lab.
